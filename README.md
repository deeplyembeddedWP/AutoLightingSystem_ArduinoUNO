Download the 'C' file. Copy and paste the c code to your Arduino IDE and perform the following steps:

1. Please visit the "https://deeplyembedded.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/design_embedded_…g_state_machines/" and 
rig up the circuit as shown in the link.

2. Compile the software in the Arduino IDE and make sure it compiles sucessfully

3. Connect you Arduino UNO to your PC.

4. Burn the program into the Arduino and open the terminal to see the UART output.
